# RedFishShield
Protect your accounts with the kiss of a RedFish.

RedFish shields are a simple way to add multi factor authentication (MFA) or passwordless login when using PCs and/or online services.

# ToDo List
 	EEPROM for passwords (1.1)
  	Passwords from Serial USB Terminal(1.2)
 	Passwords' Encryption (1.3)

# Relase Notes

	1.0
It is now possible to hardcode passwords directly into the code. For managing these passwords:

**Select Password (Key 1)**: You can now select the desired password by pressing the 1 key.

**Write Password (Key 2)**: Once a password is selected, you can automatically write it by pressing the 2 key.

# Building from Source
If you want to customize RedFishShield or contribute to the project, you should be familiar with building RedFishShield from source.
* Install Arduino IDE. I've used arduino-ide_2.3.2_Linux_64bit.AppImage on Linux and Arduino IDE Windows successfully.
* Compile and upload the project
