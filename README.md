# ToDo List
	EEPROM for passwords
 	Passwords' Encryption

# Building from Source
If you want to customize RedFishShield or contribute to the project, you should be familiar with building RedFishShield from source.
* Install Arduino IDE. I've used arduino-ide_2.3.2_Linux_64bit.AppImage on Linux and Arduino IDE Windows successfully.
* Compile and upload the project
